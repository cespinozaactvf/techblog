			<h2>Blog Post #1</h2>

			<p> This video that i just watch is about how robot can easily take over the job industry. This could really be a bad thing for humans. If the robots take over their jobs, human will lose their jobs and wouldn't be able to to get money. Different types of jobs like factories are being worked by robots. It easier and faster for the robots to worked at the factories. Also it shown that how much people loses their jobs.</p>

			<p> After watchng the video, I think that robot are stealing our jobs. Humans have a less chance to have the jobs that they wanted to work at just because robot are taking over and making them lose their jobs. Technology has chance over time. And humans needed jobs so they can get money to be able to live their life. Without money, you wouldn't be able to buy food, rent or anything else. Robots is cool but stealing our jobs isn't. </p>

			<p> This story is all about how technology is use. People like using technology because it's helpful for them to do work. Long time ago people didn't have any internet, computers, phones and tablets. probably during the 1980's is when we starting to see the modren technology like videos games, televison, and music players</p>
			<p> I just finishing reading a story called "Blown to Bits" and to be honest it was long and boring!!! I read the part of the story called "Footprints and Fingerprnts". It's about hiow we use our body part to do work. For example, we use our finger to type on the keyborad. Also we use our feet to walk to work or something like that. </p>
